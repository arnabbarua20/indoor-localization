## Real-Time Indoor Localization with WiFi Signal Data

This project focuses on visualizing real-time indoor localization using Wi-Fi signal strength data (RSSI). It includes a Python script (`wifi_scan.py`) that reads scanned signal data and visualizes user/device positions on a grid layout.

---

## Project Overview

Indoor localization is essential for tracking individuals or devices in smart environments such as:
- Warehouses
- Hospitals
- Industrial facilities
- Emergency rescue situations

This script provides real-time mapping and visualization using RSSI data collected via Wi-Fi access points or sensors.

## Features

- Real-time heatmap or scatter plot of signal strength
- Grid-based indoor mapping
- Data preprocessing and visualization using Python
- Customizable for various grid sizes and environments
