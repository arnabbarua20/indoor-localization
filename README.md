## Real-Time Indoor Localization with WiFi Signal Data

This project focuses on visualizing real-time indoor localization using Wi-Fi signal strength data (RSSI). It includes a Python script (`wifi_scan.py`) that reads scanned signal data and visualizes user/device positions on a grid layout.

---

## Project Overview

Indoor localization is essential for tracking individuals or devices in smart environments such as:
- Warehouses
- Hospitals
- Industrial facilities
- Emergency rescue situations

This script provides real-time mapping and visualization using RSSI data collected via Wi-Fi access points or sensors.

---

## Features

- Real-time heatmap or scatter plot of signal strength
- Grid-based indoor mapping
- Data preprocessing and visualization using Python
- Customizable for various grid sizes and environments

##  Requirements

Install dependencies (if not already):

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/indoor-localization.git
cd indoor-localization
````

2. **Install Required Libraries**

Make sure Python is installed (preferably 3.8 or above). Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you donâ€™t have a `requirements.txt`, just install the essentials:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

3. **Prepare Your Data**

Ensure your Wi-Fi RSSI/CSI data is saved in a CSV file like:

```
GridID, RSSI1, RSSI2, RSSI3, ...
G1, -45, -60, -70
G2, -48, -65, -72
...
```

Save this as `localization_data.csv` in the same folder as the script.

4. **Run the Visualization Script**

```bash
python wifi_scan.py
```

> This will generate a grid-based plot showing signal strength or estimated position.
